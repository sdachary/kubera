## What is Kubera?

Kubera is a **standalone, self-hosted personal finance OS** that takes you from **debt → zero → wealth** in a defined timeline.

Most finance apps are either budgeting tools or investment dashboards. Kubera is the full arc:

```
Negative  →  Zero  →  Positive
(in debt)    (free)    (wealthy)
```

The app follows one rule: **clear your liabilities before building wealth.** It doesn't block you — but it always shows debt freedom progress front and center, and investment suggestions only strengthen once debt is under control.

### ✅ Completed Phases (v0.1 → Phase 6)
- 🔧 **v0.1** — Single-line installer (`curl ... | bash`), Docker setup, AI connector
- 💳 **v0.2** — Debt Payoff Module (Avalanche/Snowball, EMI calendar, simulation)
- 📈 **v0.3** — Dividend SIP Planner (AI stock suggestions, NSE/BSE screener)
- 🔄 **v0.4** — Portfolio Rebalancing (Modern Portfolio Theory, asset allocation)
- 🔔 **v0.5** — Recurring Expense Tracker (EMI/subscription calendar, notifications)
- 🛡️ **v1.0** — Security audit & standalone architecture
- 🧹 **Phase 6** — Architecture refinement: routes cleanup (442→57 lines), dead code removal, mailer views, initializer simplification, importmap-compatible JS

- 💳 **Debt payoff tracker** — loans, EMIs, avalanche/snowball strategies
- 📈 **Dividend SIP planner** — AI suggests stocks based on your income target
- 🔄 **Portfolio rebalancing** — monthly check-ins, on/off track status
- 🔔 **Recurring expense reminders** — never miss an EMI or subscription
- 🤖 **Free AI** — works with free models via OpenRouter, or fully local via Ollama
- 🇮🇳 **NSE/BSE support** — built with Indian markets in mind
- 🧹 **Clean architecture** — refined routes (57 lines), no dead code, simplified initializers

**What makes Kubera different:**
1. **Philosophy-first** — "Debt first, then wealth" isn't a feature, it's the foundation
2. **Your data stays yours** — self-hosted, no surveillance capitalism
3. **Free AI from day one** — no $20/month for AI features
4. **Built for India** — NSE/BSE, EMIs, SIPs, ₹ currency
5. **Community-driven** — features serve users, not shareholders
6. **Standalone Architecture** — No external dependencies, all data stays local

## The Journey

### Phase 1 — Debt Freedom
List all loans and EMIs. Kubera suggests payoff order (avalanche = highest interest first, snowball = smallest balance first). Tracks monthly progress and projects your debt-free date.

### Phase 2 — Foundation Building
Once debt is healthy, SIP suggestions activate. You set a monthly contribution — even ₹500 works. AI picks 2–3 dividend stocks aligned with your timeline and goals.

### Phase 3 — Income Target
You define the goal: *"₹25,000/month passive income by 2030."* Kubera reverse-engineers the path — what SIP amount, which stocks, when to rebalance — and checks in monthly.
