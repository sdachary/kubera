## What is Kubera?

Kubera is a **self-hosted personal finance OS** that takes you from **debt → zero → wealth** in a defined timeline.

Most finance apps are either budgeting tools or investment dashboards. Kubera is the full arc:

```
Negative  →  Zero  →  Positive
(in debt)    (free)    (wealthy)
```

The app follows one rule: **clear your liabilities before building wealth.** It doesn't block you — but it always shows debt freedom progress front and center, and investment suggestions only strengthen once debt is under control.

Built on top of [Sure](https://github.com/we-promise/sure), Kubera adds:

### ✅ Completed Phases (v0.1 → v0.5)
- 🔧 **v0.1** — Single-line installer (`curl ... | bash`), Docker setup, AI connector
- 💳 **v0.2** — Debt Payoff Module (Avalanche/Snowball, EMI calendar, simulation)
- 📈 **v0.3** — Dividend SIP Planner (AI stock suggestions, NSE/BSE screener)
- 🔄 **v0.4** — Portfolio Rebalancing (Modern Portfolio Theory, asset allocation)
- 🔔 **v0.5** — Recurring Expense Tracker (EMI/subscription calendar, notifications)

**All phases implemented via mcp-hub agents:** Claude Code (frontend), Gemini CLI (typescript), NVIDIA (github)

- 💳 **Debt payoff tracker** — loans, EMIs, avalanche/snowball strategies
- 📈 **Dividend SIP planner** — AI suggests stocks based on your income target
- 🔄 **Portfolio rebalancing** — monthly check-ins, on/off track status
- 🔔 **Recurring expense reminders** — never miss an EMI or subscription
- 🤖 **Free AI** — works with free models via OpenRouter, or fully local via Ollama
- 🇮🇳 **NSE/BSE support** — built with Indian markets in mind

**What makes Kubera different:**
1. **Philosophy-first** — "Debt first, then wealth" isn't a feature, it's the foundation
2. **Your data stays yours** — self-hosted, no surveillance capitalism
3. **Free AI from day one** — no $20/month for AI features
4. **Built for India** — NSE/BSE, EMIs, SIPs, ₹ currency
5. **Community-driven** — features serve users, not shareholders

## The Journey

### Phase 1 — Debt Freedom
List all loans and EMIs. Kubera suggests payoff order (avalanche = highest interest first, snowball = smallest balance first). Tracks monthly progress and projects your debt-free date.

### Phase 2 — Foundation Building
Once debt is healthy, SIP suggestions activate. You set a monthly contribution — even ₹500 works. AI picks 2–3 dividend stocks aligned with your timeline and goals.

### Phase 3 — Income Target
You define the goal: *"₹25,000/month passive income by 2030."* Kubera reverse-engineers the path — what SIP amount, which stocks, when to rebalance — and checks in monthly.

## Install in One Line

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdachary/kubera/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer is an interactive TUI — no documentation reading required:

- ✅ Checks for Docker, offers to install if missing
- ✅ Detects port conflicts, suggests free alternatives
- ✅ Walks you through AI provider setup (or skip for later)
- ✅ Generates all config files with secure random keys
- ✅ Pulls Docker images and starts everything

**Other commands:**

```bash
# Update to latest
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdachary/kubera/main/install.sh | bash -s update

# View logs
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdachary/kubera/main/install.sh | bash -s logs

# Check status
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdachary/kubera/main/install.sh | bash -s status

# Uninstall
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdachary/kubera/main/install.sh | bash -s uninstall
```

## AI Assistant — Bring Your Own Key

Kubera works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. **Free options work great.**

| Provider | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenRouter** | Free tier | Llama 3.1 70B, Gemma 2, Mistral — all free |
| **Ollama** | Free (local) | Runs on your machine, no data leaves |
| **Anthropic** | Paid | Claude — best quality |
| **OpenAI** | Paid | GPT-4o mini — good balance |
| **Custom** | Varies | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

The installer walks you through choosing one. You can also skip and configure later in **Settings → AI Assistant**.

## Architecture

Kubera = Sure (Maybe Finance fork) + Kubera-specific features

- **Sure/Maybe**: Handles transactions, budgets, investments, AI chat
- **Kubera Layer**: Adds debt payoff tracker, SIP planner, Indian market features

Most application code lives in [Sure](https://github.com/we-promise/sure). This repo handles distribution, installer, and Kubera-specific extensions.
